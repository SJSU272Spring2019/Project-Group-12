Final project for CMPE272

Title: Predicting Car Break Ins Using ML/AI

Abstract: Car break ins are very common in large metropolitan areas, but they also happen in small cities around the country. By predicting the car break ins patterns, enforcement agencies will be better equipped to handles these acts of vandalism. 

Summary: The purpose of this project is use machine learning algorithms to predict hot zones, where car break ins occur the most often. The user will be able to query in a web application what city/area is a dangerous zone to park his/her car. The query response will provide the user with the likelihood the car break in will happen. The probability will depend on the location, latitude and longitude, day and time when the user parks.
